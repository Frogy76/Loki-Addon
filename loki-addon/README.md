# Home Assistant Add-on: Grafana Loki

Grafana Loki (https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) as a Home Assistant add-on.

## About this Add-on

Grafana Loki is a horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by Prometheus. It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

This add-on is based on the original Grafana Loki add-on by bluemaex, but has been updated with a newer version of Loki (v3.4.3) and includes the following improvements:

- Extended configuration options for resource management
- Security settings with optional authentication
- Example configurations for Promtail
- Pre-built Grafana dashboards
- Automatic backup integration
- Improved error handling

## Notes

For information on configuring this add-on, see the [Documentation](DOCS.md).
